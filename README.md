# Neural-Net (pre-pre beta or sumn idk)

Very low-functionality neural network system with a slight hint of "unfinished project". 
Might pick this up in the future but if you wanna use it be my guest, i'd be happy to help.

Update: picking this shit up again fr

## Vision
- A modular neural network system that can be applied to several systems with quick learning
- A "simple" system for assigning score functions to training models
- A pre-trainable model and a real-time model

## Long-Term
- Integrate low-level code for better performance
- Focus on runtime efficiency

### Pre trained models:
- Optimisation for data processing

### Real-time Models
- Optimisation for gestures (Organic LED Motions)
- Environmental interaction systems (sound systems, motion boards, etc)
